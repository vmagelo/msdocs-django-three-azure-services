# Deploy a Python (Django) web app with PostgreSQL in Azure

This is a Python web app using the Django framework and the Azure Database for PostgreSQL relational database service. The Django app is hosted in a fully managed Azure App Service. This app is designed to be be run locally and then deployed to Azure. For more information on how to use this web app, see the tutorial [*Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app with PostgreSQL in Azure*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-python-postgresql-app).

If you need an Azure account, you can [create on for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

A Flask sample application is also available for the article at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-flask-postgresql-sample-app.

## Requirements

The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) has the following packages:

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Django](https://pypi.org/project/Django/) | Web application framework. |
| [pyscopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg-binary/) | PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. |
| [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) | Read key-value pairs from .env file and set them as environment variables. In this sample app, those variables describe how to connect to the database locally. <br><br> This package is used in the [manage.py](./manage.py) file to load environment variables. |
| [whitenoise](https://pypi.org/project/whitenoise/) | Static file serving for WSGI applications, used in the deployed app. <br><br> This package is used in the [azureproject/production.py](./azureproject/production.py) file, which configures production settings. |

## How to run (Windows)

Create virtual environment.

```dos
py -m venv .venv
.venv/scripts/activate
```

Install the dependencies.

```dos
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the `restaurant` and `review` tables.

```dos
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the app.

```dos
python manage.py runserver
```

## Tips for development (Windows)

### Tip 1

When making [model.py](./restaurant_review/models.py) changes run `python manage.py makemigrations` to pick up those changes. For more information, see [django-admin and manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/#makemigrations). Run `python manage.py migrate` after `makemigrations`.

### Tip 2

When creating a new PostgreSQL locally, for example with Azure Data Studio:

```dos
CREATE DATABASE <database-name>;
```

Or, with psql.exe:

```dos
psql --username=<user-name> --password <password>

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE <database-name>;
postgres=# \c <database-name>
postgres=# \l
postgres=# \du
postgres=# \q
```

### Tip 3

To create an GUID in Python, use [UUIDField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/#uuidfield), which creates a universally unique identifier. When used with PostgreSQL, this stores in a **uuid** datatype.

```python
import uuid
from django.db import models

id = models.UUIDField()
```


### Tip 4

To work with the Python SDK and Azure Blob Storage, see [Quickstart: Manage blobs with Python v12 SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python).

Create container called *restaurants* and set access level to *Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)*.
